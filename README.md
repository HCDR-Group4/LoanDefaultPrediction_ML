# Leveraging Machine Learning to Predict Loan Defaults
This project was prepared as part of our coursework for **CSCI-P556: Applied Machine Learning** at Indiana University Bloomington. It is a comprehensive machine learning project aimed at predicting loan defaults using advanced techniques, including Logistic Regression, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). The project involves feature engineering, handling class imbalance, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation to optimize performance. It includes detailed analysis, implementation, and results based on the [Kaggle Home Credit Default Risk dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk).
